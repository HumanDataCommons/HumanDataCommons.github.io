The Human Data Commons Foundation is proud to present its first annual "Quantified Self Report Card" - a review of user-facing privacy practices within the Quantified Self consumer industry. The rise of biometric data collection and self-tracking has further complicated the already contentious debate about digital user rights. Though the vast reserves of data that can be collected from personal tracking devices pose some new threats, they also provides new opportunities for users to reclaim control over their own data, and contribute it consensually to social good research.
