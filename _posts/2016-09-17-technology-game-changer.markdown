It seems increasingly easy these days to be a technodeterminist-- someone who thinks that technological innovations exert the dominant influence on humanity's immediate future. After all, the development of computers seems to have triggered an urgent gold rush of invention and communication. 

Hey, I'm sure during the rise of factories most contemporary theorists were industrial-determinists. Perhaps in the age of Gutenberg, social commentary was driven by printing-determinism. Computer technology just happen to be the rapid current rushing through our own time, seeming to push things ahead all around us. Discussions of 'technology as a game changer' proliferate online and in person.

#### What is it Good For? Absolutely *Something*

As a society, we're still trying to pin down what exactly all of these devices, web pages, and algorithms may be doing to change our world. But most often, analyses will zero in on one aspect of technology's effects. Some of the most prevalent fixations are the rapidly advancing automated environments deemed "the Internet of Things", the changes in human interaction on social media, and revelations about quiet and worrisome campaigns of widespread surveillance. 

The truth is that each piece of the puzzle must be fit together carefully, not isolated under a microscope. There are reasons for both pessimism and optimism when we look at the shifting public sphere. Technology provides us with new freedoms, as well as encumbering us under new chains. We can push our voices into the public sphere in a way never before imagined-- and they can be drowned out by the constant noise.

#### Lahlou's "Three Layered Leopardskin of Change" Model

To understand technological change from a critical conceptual level, it's ideal to utilize a model which accounts for simultaneous developments across multiple levels. In my grad school research, I was particularly wooed by [Saadi Lahlou's (2008) "Three Layered Leopardskin of Change"](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27804/1/Cognitive_technologies,_social_science_and_the_three-layered_leopardskin_of_change_(lsero).pdf) description-- as useful as its title is poetic. 

Lahlou delineates three complex and interwoven layers to technology in society: its physical development, its human representations and practices, and its institutional rules and norms. 

* The physical development of technology is, of course, invention and adjustment of the tools themselves. 

* The representative practices that surround technology are largely determined by their organic adoption within cultures and communities. 

* The institutional norms which regulate the use of new technologies are forged through the establishment of precedents. 

Lahlou (2008) positions the evolution of technology across these layers within a "domestication" framework, in which new devices at first disrupt societal practices, then become familiar and subsumed into them, and finally lead to redefinition of the societal norms themselves. 

He argues that the physical layer of computer technology is evolving the most rapidly, and that our social and cultural responses to increasingly advanced devices inevitably lag behind. We can all envision the unsustainability of a leopardskin separated from its spots (a delightfully gross visceral metaphor).

#### The Flux of Deterministic Influences

It's important to remember that the elements which shape domestication process are interdependent rather than unidirectional, and these different layers must be recognized as equal parts of an ever-evolving cultural system.  

For example, at the representative cultural level, user interest determines mass adoption of new technologies, rather than the design and intentions of its creators. You can craft a delightful device but if it doesn't appeal to the crowds it will fail miserably. And heaven forbid it gets made fun of out of the gate [(cough, cough, Google Glass)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160602223015/http://www.forbes.com/sites/ianaltman/2015/04/28/why-google-glass-failed-and-why-apple-watch-could-too/#47da18c94f96). 

The sometimes fickle nature of mass user response shows that just because you invent something doesn't mean you have any control over its adoption and use. Most of the time, the perspectives and desires of the largest population will direct which tools survive, and which fade into obscurity.

#### Where Does This All Fit?

It's useful to keep the general framework of this model in mind, but how does it help us address the complex and multifaceted interpretations of technology's application? I want to further ride the wave of this model by proposing some values and motivations that may be embedded in the development process of each layer. 

* At the physical and material level, in the basements of hackers and the laboratories of Silicon Valley, there is a thirst for knowledge and creative problem-solving (and, of course, money, but that's inherent to any commercial industry). 

* In cultural adoption of technologies, there's a prioritization of convenience and comfort, hence the domestication of initially radical tools into familiar and easier-to-use interfaces. 

* The institutional level (which I will cover in greater depth in future posts) is imbued with the motivation to maintain traditional and recognizable order and control over societies despite the disruptive effects of new technologies. 

The clash and interweaving of values, motivations, and exercises of power between these layers is, I think, what shapes the unique reality we currently live in. 

While hobbyist inventors grasp for new ways to empower individuals, those enlisted by commercial corporations pursue methods to track and profile them. While popular culture speaks lip service to the liberatory capabilities of the Internet-- what we'd like to *believe* we want from it-- the majority of users spend their time on Facebook or Youtube. Finally, while technological breakthroughs break down traditional limitations of structural and material ownership, legislation is rushed through to ensure that the new media is controlled by the same rules as the old.

Through informal case studies and investigations of theoretical perspectives,the series of blog posts that follow this introductory essay will interrogate these complex issues as they play out in real life. There's no right answer to any of the questions we face, and there's no pinning down the flux of a change that is constantly occurring all around us. I look forward to hearing and engaging with different perspectives on the multiple layers and influences of this intensely exciting shift, which we are all simultaneously swept up in **and** actively shaping with our actions and choices.
