Alongside [OuiShare](http://ouishare.net/en) in France, the Human Data Commons Foundation was recently announced as a new caretaker node for the [Interplanetary Database Foundation](https://ipdb.foundation/). IPDB — the Interplanetary Database — is made up of two parts: a blockchain-style database for the world computer and a not-for-profit foundation that guides it. The IPDB foundation provides governance for the database, guiding its growth and allowing it to respond to any challenges it faces. The foundation’s members are the caretakers, and each runs a server node that stores and validates transactions. Together these nodes make up the IPDB database. IPDB offers a public platform for trust, backed by the reputation of the caretakers.

As a public scalable blockchain database and a foundation, IPDB relies on caretakers for both governance and technology. The caretakers elect the board of directors and help guide the foundation. The caretakers also run the nodes that store and validate transactions sent to the network. The criteria for selecting caretakers is simple. They must be an organization committed to keeping the internet free and decentralized. More than half of the caretakers must be not-for-profit organizations. IPDB also encourages jurisdictional diversity, meaning fewer than half of the caretakers can be in any one country.

“Both of these new caretakers brings a unique perspective on how we can build technological systems that put people and governance first,” said Greg McMullen, co-founder and Executive Director of the IPDB Foundation. “We are thrilled that we’ll have their voices contributing to decisions about the direction IPDB should take.”

In return, the Human Data Commons Foundation is honoured to participate in this collaboration. “We’re excited to act as a Canadian caretaker node for the IPDB, exploring the new territory of decentralized governance with so many other great organizations,” said Scott Nelson, the HDC Foundation’s Board Chair.
