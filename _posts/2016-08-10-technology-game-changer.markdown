It seems increasingly easy these days to be a technodeterminist-- i.e., someone who thinks that technological innovations exert the dominant influence on humanity's immediate future. After all, the development of computers seems to have triggered an urgent gold rush of invention and communication. Hey, I'm sure during the rise of factories a number of thinkers were industrial determinists. Information and communication technology just happen to be the rapid current rushing through our own time, seeming to push things ahead all around us. Discussions of 'technology as a game changer' proliferate online and in person. 

**A Multitude of Effects**

As a society, we're still trying to pin down what exactly all of these devices, web pages, and algorithms may be doing to us. But most often, analyses will focus on one aspect of technology's effects, whether it's the rapidly advancing automated environments deemed "the Internet of Things", or the changes in human interaction on social media, or revelations about quiet and worrisome campaigns of widespread surveillance. The truth is that each piece of the puzzle must be fit together carefully, not isolated under a microscope. There are reasons for both pessimism and optimism when we look at these rapid advances. Technology provides us with new freedoms, as well as new chains. We can push our voices into the public sphere in a way never before imagined-- and they can be drowned out by the noise.

**Lahlou's "Three Layered Leopardskin of Change" Model**

To understand technological change from a critical conceptual level, it's ideal to utilize a model which accounts for simultaneous developments across multiple levels. In my grad school research, I was particularly wooed by Lahlou's (2008) "Three Layered Leopardskin of Change" description-- as useful as its title is poetic. Lahlou delineates three complex and interwoven layers to technology in society: its physical development, its human representations and practices, and its institutional rules and norms. 

The physical development of technology is, of course, invention and adjustment of the tools themselves. The representative practices that surround technology are largely determined by their organic adoption within cultures and communities. Finally, the institutional norms which regulate the use of new technologies are forged through the establishment of precedents. Lahlou (2008) positions the evolution of technology across these layers within a "domestication" framework, in which new devices at first disrupt societal practices, then become familiar and subsumed into them, and finally lead to redefinition of the norms themselves. He argues that the physical layer of computer technology is evolving the most rapidly, and that our social and cultural responses to increasingly advanced devices inevitably lag behind. 

**The Flux of Deterministic Influences**

It's important to remember that the elements which shape domestication process are interdependent rather than unidirectional, and these different layers must be recognized as equal parts of an ever-evolving cultural system (Hughes, 2004; Bakardjieva, 2005; Lahlou, 2008; Lingus, 2012).  For example, at the representative cultural level, user interest determines mass adoption of new technologies, rather than the design and intentions of its creators. You can craft a delightful device but if it doesn't appeal to the crowds it will fail miserably. And heaven forbid it gets made fun of out of the gate [cough, cough, Google Glass]. This shows that, even though the initial physical inventions that shift the direction of technology anchor its planned path, the perspectives and desires of the largest population will direct which tools survive, and which fade into obscurity.

**Where Does This All Fit?**

It's useful to keep the general framework of this model in mind, but how does it help us address the complex and multifaceted interpretations of technology's application? I want to further ride the wave of this model by projecting some values and motivations that may be attached to each of these layers. At the physical and material level, in the basements of hackers and the laboratories of Silicon Valley, there is a thirst for knowledge and creative problem-solving [and, of course, money, but that exists at every level]. In cultural adoption of technologies, there's a prioritization of convenience and comfort, hence the domestication of initially radical tools into familiar and easier-to-use interfaces. Finally, the institutional level-- which I've failed to address much up until this point-- is imbued with the motivation to maintain traditional and recognizable order and control over societies despite the disruptive effects of new technologies. 

The clash and interweaving of values, motivations, and exercises of power between these layers is, I think, what shapes the unique reality we currently live in. While hobbyist inventors grasp for new ways to empower individuals, those enlisted by commercial corporations pursue methods to track and profile them. While popular culture speaks lip service to the liberatory capabilities of the Internet-- what we'd like to believe we want from it-- the majority of users spend their time on Facebook or Youtube. And while technological breakthroughs break down traditional limitations of structural and material ownership, legislation is rushed through to ensure that the new media is controlled by the same rules as the old. The series that will follow this introductory essay will attempt, through informal case studies and investigations of theoretical perspectives, to interrogate these complex issues as they play out in real life.
