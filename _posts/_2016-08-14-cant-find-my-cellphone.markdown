So I’ve been writing a lot about technology, for awhile now. Immersing myself in articles, books, and discussions about how pervasively it’s invaded our lives. And by our, I mean myself and all the other privileged people who have constant access to tech devices.<sup>1</sup>

It is a privilege. I always knew this, but it got hammered much more concretely into my brain on a fun little foray into the vibrant and volatile side of the city recently. Vancouver’s Downtown East Side is its own sandboxed ecosystem, with social governance, behavioural norms, and a grey market barter economy like nothing I’ve ever seen. A cultural dialogue completely free of the fake niceties and intensive politeness that seems to permeate cities out here on the West Coast-- tools intended to avoid even the tiniest slice of social discomfort. In the DTES, like on much of the East Coast, straight talkers are the norm. People call one another out-- but they also help each other out. It’s one of the most tight knit communities I’ve ever seen, and hot take: I find it way more comfortable than "genteel society."

So a couple of weeks ago, I went to hang out with some folks in the DTES. I was headed home from a few pints with an old friend, and walking along Hastings it occurred to me-- I’d had a couple meetings recently about possible implementations of mobile technology to solve social problems in the DTES, and the direction ahead on those projects would be greatly helped by understanding just how cellphones are currently used by these folks.

I’m not particularly fond of formal clipboard-on-the-street type research-- my schooling has pointed me much more in the direction of immersive praxis. Studs Terkel, Paolo Friere, Upton Sinclair. For me, it’s rude to try to ask people to cram their life experience into preformed questions presented within a sterile, lifeless environment. I’d prefer to hear people’s stories in their own language, even if it takes me some time to understand the syntax, so to speak.

I hung out late, way later than I planned. As the people I sat with grew emboldened, some activities that  were maybe a bit outside of my comfort zone, and of the scope of the law, went down in the space around me. I'm still just young enough to care too much about seeming cool, so I kept my thoughts to myself. I instead just listened to stories, listened to how people had gotten where they were, what made them happy, what pissed them off, what gave them hope. I had a fantastic time. And then I rose from my criss cross applesauce stance on the sidewalk just before midnight to bid all adieu. Made it across the street to the bus stop before I realized that the usual weight in my jacket pocket was no longer there. Somebody had swiped my fancy pants smartphone.

I certainly didn't "deserve" getting my phone stolen-- no one deserves theft, of course. However, I came to a subtle understanding throughout the process of being phone-less in the modern First World framework for 36 hours. The main thing I realized is that while it wildly inconvenienced me, caused me some info-access anxiety, made me flip around the whole shape of my workdays, it didn't destroy me. I didn't deserve to lose my phone, but I could [just barely] afford to do so. I was able to dip into my humble savings and get another one within two days.

For me, this inspires awareness of, and gratitude about, my place on the spectrum of economic class. As with many of my peers, I am in astronomical student debt, to the point that [outside of monthly payments] the sum is almost entirely abstract in my mind. Perhaps because of that ease of abstraction, I manage my income in order to maintain some of the trippings of middle class life. As opposed to someone living hand to mouth, I am keeping the debt's wolf at bay while still providing myself a short-term safety net. Someone on extremely limited income and/or with bad credit and/or in an unstable housing situation does not have that buffer, that "two thousand bucks emergency fund". I think when we talk about poverty that aspect slips through the cracks too often -- true, abject poverty allows for no backup plans.

I still keep a passive eye out on Hastings Street's grey market-- I doubt there are very many Android phones with an Ubuntu sticker on the back, it would be pretty easy to spot. But I ultimately just ended up feeling grateful after this inconvenience. I tried to hold onto the lesson that it was beating into me: I'm incredibly lucky. Perhaps many of you reading this are doing so on a tiny touchscreen computer that you can fit in your pocket, or a sleek metal-bodied laptop. These devices, and the instantaneous information and connections they enable, are a great privilege.
