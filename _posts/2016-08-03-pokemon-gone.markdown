For Fuchs (2012), a wide spectrum of technocultural perspectives exist, from utopian endorsements of the internet's liberatory capacity to pessimistic suspicions about the rise of surveillance and centralized control. These polar extremes share a common feature: they bely a technological determinism which anchors society's future growth in the outcomes of ICT, and which “assumes that a certain technology has exactly one specific effect on society” (Fuchs, 2012, p. 387). A more holistic and grounded view projects a realistic, dialectical relationship between technology and society.

Let's take something that has impressively flooded the Western cultural sphere here in Summer 2016-- Pokemon Go. I was never a Pokeman person, in child- or adult-hood, so I had the opportunity to observe this whole phenomenon with somewhat of an objective distance. [Explain it, background of Ingress, and how it dominated the news and social media-- include some link examples].

Commentators ran the gamut of technocultural takes on this: that the launch of Pokemon Go was the first truly successful implementation of augmented reality gaming; that it got people out of their houses and immersed in [a hybrid version of] their local community; that it put up further walls in public interaction, with everyone staring at their screens; that it furthered agendas of surveillance and movement tracking by corporations and potentially governments; that it presents yet another shiny distraction from the jarring realities of politics and world events.

Here's the truth, along the lines of Fuchs' (2012) argument: Pokemon Go has done all of these things. It has brought people together, and it has alienated them from one another. It has encouraged people to walk more consciously through their communities, going places they haven't necessarily gone before, while providing the GPS metadata of their travels to [niantic? nintendo? who owns this]. It has given pop culture some good memes to laugh at together, and it has distracted people from some important social and political issues that it's hard to face head on.

On the physical level, Pokemon Go pulls a number of different technological developments together: a pretty Nintendo graphical interface wrapped along the crowd-tested, nerd-approved A.R. infrastructure of the game Ingress, built upon and continually building a smart map of neighborhoods, cities, and networks of human movement. It's an impressive achievement on a tiny cell phone [though I've heard it drains the battery like crazy].

On the cultural level, the game has yanked a whole bunch of nostalgia from a widespread population, and has brought in the enthusiasm of new, especially young, players who have never before known the franchise.
