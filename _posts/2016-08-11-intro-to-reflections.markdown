There's often a hard line driven between the supposed realms of subjective and objective reality. Our feelings, thoughts, and stories are for journals and cocktail parties, whereas rigorously controlled experiments, tightly focused on specific potential correlation, form the bedrock of what we call truth. There's nothing wrong with that, of course; when I end up in the emergency room I don't want my treatment based on what some doctor's grandma might have said (no matter how clever folk wisdom can be). Science, medicine, technology-- these disciplines depend upon verifiable and reproducible models of truth as it plays out in the physical world.

However, when it comes to culture and human nature, I think the line between the stories we tell ourselves and the mainstream narrative is a lot more blurred. The Internet has accelerated this shift towards a multiplicity of voices and truths, in many ways. Not that long ago, to find alternative news sources, you might have to track down your local radical bookstore [if it exists] or do some deep digging on your own. Where the Associated Press used to break nation-wide news stories, mainstream media outlets are increasingly turning to frontline individuals' Twitter posts and crowdsourced discussions.

**Whose Story to Believe?**

To return to the classic perspective of rational objectivity, these proliferating stories present a problem: where's the verifiability? When Google is clogged with a mixture of opinions, forum discussions, and actual research, how do we collectively decide whose story we're sticking with? My suggestion is this: when it comes to elements of our world that are more philosophy than physicality, we could let the cacophony ring out. Rather than zooming in the lens on one or two major perspectives, pulling ourselves back to the centralized style of media dissemination, we teach and learn the crucial skills of critical reading and balance analysis.

**Critical Reading in the Internet Age**

Critical reading and analysis require the ability to take a source's context into consideration, to evaluate for clues of bias, and to measure the tone [from serious to silly] of a piece we're reading. If we prioritize these skills we can welcome a much more diverse range of self-expression into the milieu of online communication without compromising the integrity of information transmission. In other words, I can tell you a story about the time my cell phone was stolen and I realized how dependent I am on it, and that story can contribute a small but valuable perspective on the way we use our devices, without being misinterpreted as carrying the same weight as a large scale, carefully designed public survey on the matter. In other words, cultural context can be enriched rather than flattened if we create platforms for all sorts of speaking and knowing.

**Human Voices Ring True**

Some of my favourite sources when I wrote my Master's thesis on these topics were casual but insightful stories: Patton Oswalt's recollection of his need for "social media vacations", moot's [blah blah blah], and Monica Lewinsky's deeply powerful TEDTalk on being "Patient Zero of Internet Shaming." Why did these affect me more deeply than studies on narcissism correlated with Facebook use, or phantom text syndrome? Well, I'm assuming because I could see the echoes of my own experience within theirs, and it made me feel a connection, human to human, that pierces to the heart of these communication platforms. After all, we've built technology that allows us to hear one another a lot more clearly, if we choose to do so.
