There's often a hard line driven between the realms of subjective and objective reality. Our feelings, thoughts, and stories are for diaries and cocktail parties, whereas rigorously controlled and tightly focused experiments form the bedrock of what we call truth. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. When I end up in the emergency room I don't want my treatment based on what some doctor's grandma might have said (no matter how clever folk wisdom can be). 

Science, medicine, technology-- these disciplines aim to build verifiable models which are reproducible in the physical world. These advances benefit humanity immeasurably. When it comes to human culture, though, the line between the stories we tell ourselves and the mainstream narrative is a lot more blurred.

#### New Ideas and Old Biases

Modern technology has provided opportunities for people to access narratives and perspectives they may never have thought about otherwise. Not very long ago, to find alternative news sources, you might have to track down your local radical bookstore (if it exists) or do some deep digging on your own. Where the Associated Press used to break nation-wide news stories, mainstream media outlets are increasingly turning to frontline individuals' Twitter posts and crowdsourced discussions. 

Unfortunately, the utopian idea of egalitarian online culture feels a bit far-fetched. Many users utilize the Internet to reinforce their existing perspectives and communicate with like-minded people. Though geographical boundaries are knocked down, self-selected silos are going up in their place.

#### You Can't "Win" a Fight on the Internet

In addition to the problem of echo chambers online, the cornucopia of stories online presents another problem: where's the verifiability? When Google is clogged with a mixture of opinions, forum discussions, and actual research, how do we decide which sources to believe? 

My suggestion is this: when it comes to elements of our world that are more philosophy than physicality, we could let the cacophony ring out. Rather than zooming in the lens on one or two major perspectives, and pulling ourselves back to the centralized style of media dissemination, we teach and learn the crucial skills of critical reading and balance analysis.

#### Ground Rules for Conversational Decency?

In most of the arguments that ring out across the Web, there is no firm line between who's right and who's wrong. There could instead be new criteria for legitimacy in dialogue: 

* *Who is respectful versus who is raging mad*; 
* *Who is listening versus who is ranting*; 
* and *who provides sources and thoughtful commentary versus [who indulges in logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/).*

If we collectively take "agreeing to disagree" as a foundational assumption of online debate (a pipe dream, I know!), we can move beyond defensiveness and focus on truly listening. In situations where there's a true fracture, and the other party seems irrationally angry, it's time to disengage, rather than sinking to their level (I won't hide the fact that I am very, very bad at this, personally). [Let's stop feeding the trolls](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/533561/the-cost-of-trolling/) and maybe they'll starve.

#### Walking a Mile in a Writer's Shoes

Some of my favourite sources when I wrote my Master's thesis on power and technology were casual but insightful personal stories. [Patton Oswalt's recollection of his need for "social media vacations"](https://web.archive.org/web/20140828111855/http://time.com/3194138/patton-oswalt-quit-twitter-fast-summer/), [moot's struggle with the invasive nature of social media](https://web.archive.org/web/20140907043847/http://chrishateswriting.com/post/91377582198/social-media), and [Monica Lewinsky's deeply powerful TEDTalk on being "Patient Zero of Internet Shaming"](https://www.ted.com/talks/monica_lewinsky_the_price_of_shame?language=en). 

Why did these affect me more deeply than quantitative studies and abstract academic theory? I'm assuming it's because I could see traces of my own experience within their stories. These personal narratives made me feel a connection, human to human, and this foundational feeling of connection made me more willing to hear out opinions that conflicted with my own. 

We've built technology that allows us to hear one another a lot more clearly, if we choose to do so. Eroding the idea that the rational objectivist view of "provable truth" applies to abstract ideas, ethics, and personal choices could knock down some of those ideological siloes and inch us toward that utopian Internet where everyone gets a chance to say their piece.
