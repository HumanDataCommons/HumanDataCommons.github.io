Though the terms themselves are at times abstract and subjective, the language of "values" transcends disciplines and fields. We all have some sort of conception of what "freedom" and "integrity" mean to us. We inevitably feel more of a connection to some of these words than to others. This helps us identify our motivations to truly contribute and dedicate ourselves to any given pursuit or cause.

The movement to set a purposeful foundation of values in any project or endeavour don't just exist to make everyone feel good about themselves. Vision shouldn't be about propping up worker morale, and mission shouldn't be just another veiled way to say business plan. These concepts should instead form the bedrock for connecting to other organizations, communities, and even legal and governance structures outside of the project.

#### Universal Change Requires Universal Communication

Let me try to construct an example of how vision transcends specializations. There are many efforts and projects across multiple sectors which prioritize *global sustainability*.

* There are efforts to fight world hunger, to ensure the safety of crops and to address the dwindling supply of water.
* There are organizations that focus on ethical recycling practices, mitigating the effects of e-waste in Asia and Africa, and breaking down the islands of accumulated plastics and trash in the oceans.
* There are scientists and researchers racing to understand, detect, and cure diseases and health problems which significantly limit the lifespan of many global citizens.
* There are activists fighting to protect endangered species of flora and fauna, to maintain green spaces and to slow the pace of global warming.
* There are inventors creating technological devices which will allow us to better research and understand ourselves and the world around us.

All of these practitioners and participants are focused in on different pieces of the same larger picture-- ensuring a safe and healthy future for the Earth and its inhabitants. That future won't happen if only one of these sectors succeeds in their goals.

That doesn't mean we should all zoom our lenses out and try to tackle all of the world's problems at once-- quite the opposite. Specialization is key for getting things accomplished effectively. In order for it to mean anything on a larger scale, though, the connections and trust need to be established by all groups working toward that vision.

When the stakeholders involved in any project purposefully and clearly discuss what sustainability means to them, with all voices given their turn to speak, a much more well-rounded conception of that shared ideal future can be established.

#### Values are to Invention what CSS is to HTML

I find values-talk to be the hardest sell in the hard tech crowd of programmers, engineers, and others whose passion and work involve a great deal of concrete logic. Fair enough-- "freedom" is (in addition to another word for nothing left to lose) an ethereal and subjective term. So I'll pitch another metaphor: think of these holistic community development concepts as the CSS style sheet to a larger repository of making-things-happen.

True, the style sheet does not really accomplish anything on its own.[^1] It's a framework or plan to shape the layout of the rest of the (more functional and concrete) code. You pick your consistent characteristics and preferred style ahead of time, adjust as needed, and you're set.

So then, let's say the rest of the project is in HTML. You could technically move forward with an HTML project without using CSS or anything like it, just defining and endlessly redefining style and formatting parameters within the code as you write it. However, it's time consuming, messy, and involves tons of unnecessary repetition along every step of the way. Why not just envision what you want the output to look like at the beginning, and store all that bigger-picture information in one neat and tidy place?

Tying the metaphor back-- if all involved and interested parties sit down at the very beginning of a project and discuss what they'd like to achieve both in the short and long term, it prevents a bunch of potentially derailing squabbling and disorganization down the line.

Reaching an agreement ahead of time enables a smoother building process. It reduces the likelihood that important ethical decisions will have to be made on a rushed case-by-case basis. With all the cards on the table, individual creativity can actually flow more freely. The tech roadmap can shift and adapt as necessary, but the core vision serves as a steady marker of where that road should lead.
