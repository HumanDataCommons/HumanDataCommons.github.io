The HDCâ€™s immediate mission is to foster interdisciplinary discussion about how to shape the ethics and protocols for an anonymized open data commons to benefit the collective integral wellbeing of humans.

Our long-term vision is to develop a fully anonymous database of voluntarily contributed user information, collected via personal development and biomedical tracking services, which will be accessible to approved institutions for research on human health and wellness.
