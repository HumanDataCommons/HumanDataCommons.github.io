The Human Data Commons Foundation was formed to address the increasing ethical problems caused by the scaling collection of personal data. Contemporary technology enables the development of massive databases which can be utilized for research and analysis, but at present, these are mainly built without transparency or accountability.

By establishing collaborations between big data companies, wellness researchers, and information security innovators, the HDC will create a scalable database with a focus on user consent and best practices in privacy and security.
